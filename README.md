## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- There were conflicting CSS rules that hindered my changes. For example, centering text on the reverse side of the flashcards took longer than expected because I overlooked multiple relevant CSS rules I had previously written.
- It took a while for me to modify my code so that clicking on the flashcard did not result in switching to another flashcard.
